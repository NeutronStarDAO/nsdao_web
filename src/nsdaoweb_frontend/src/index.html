                    We aim to promote awareness of Internet computers, blockchain, and various Dapps in the IC ecosystem to a wider audience (Including but not limited to blockchain content.). We love blockchain technology and wish to collectively produce all kinds of content related to blockchain. In addition to publishing articles and videos, we also operate an open community. Everyone is welcome to join us for chat, discussions, news updates, seeking help, learning about the latest information, developing Dapps, and more.

                <h2>NSDAO Manifesto</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that NSDAO is decentralized, so any organization or individual in the world can refer to themselves as NSDAO and publish articles in its name. NSDAO does not belong to any organization or individual, and there are no restrictions imposed on any organization or individual by NSDAO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website and the logo used on the website are only one of the creations of NSDAO, and also the first website of NSDAO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of initiating NSDAO is to establish a content creation DAO that is free, open, and shared to all. Articles published under the name of NSDAO are permanently free, and the copyright and ownership of the articles belong to everyone who uses the Internet. The article publisher can choose to leave a wallet address for tips at the end of the article, so if someone finds the article particularly valuable, they can support the author to continue creating content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We recommend that NSDAO articles be published on the blockchain as much as possible.
                    Anyone can copy and share NSDAO articles and publish them on the Internet (Without any restrictions), but the relevant publication time can be used to determine where the article first appeared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When people publish articles in the name of NSDAO, it represents that the author unconditionally opens up the article to everyone in the world. This contribution may be a small step for the individual, but it is a giant leap for human civilization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The author publishes the article through a blockchain system and can choose to remain completely anonymous or publicly identify themselves for others to read the article without permission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the article is unconditionally open, others may freely use NSDAO articles for derivative works or even profit from them. However, it is believed that the earliest published article will be the most popular. NSDAO represents a spirit of openness and freedom on the Internet, and pays tribute to Aaron Swartz and the countless pioneers who have fought for openness. To some extent, the NSDAO declaration is also a continuation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerilla_Open_Access_Manifesto">the Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto</a>.

                <h2>There is no governance!</h2>
                <p>The slogan of NSDAO: Unlocking openness, fostering fairness.</p>
                <p>
                    To be precise, NSDAO is a completely decentralized internet culture. It has no structure, belongs to no one, and I believe it does not require any form of management. Likewise, no individual is liable for legal responsibility concerning articles published under the name of NSDAO.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    When publishing articles in the name of NSDAO, you may choose to remain anonymous, use a temporary pseudonym, or use your real name.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The format for the signature is as follows: "(Pseudonym) from NSDAO: (Wallet address)"
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example:<br />
                    Anonymous: "NSDAO: eda12gri9agf..."<br />
                    Temporary pseudonym: "N from NSDAO: eda12gri9agf..."<br />
                    Real name: "Nash Zheng from NSDAO: eda12gri9agf..."
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    This signature represents that the article adheres to the NSDAO declaration and is unconditionally published on the Internet. Anyone may freely view and use the article.
